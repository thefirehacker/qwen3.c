# qwen3.c

`qwen3.c` is a minimal, single-file C implementation of Qwen3 model inference, designed to run without any dependencies and inherited from llama2.c. It directly loads GGUF-format tensors without any conversion, making it self-contained.

Just for clarity, the tokenizer reads vocab and merges from .txt files, which makes it way easier to understand. The overhead from tokenization and detokenization from text files is negligible compared to the forward pass, so it has little to no effect on TTS. The  implementation supports multi-turn conversation, ~~but it uses a naive full-token pass, which causes TTFT or the prefill time to increase as the number of tokens grows at the moment.~~ and sustains the same TTFT as in single-turn conversation. With OpenMP enabled, TPS stays decent at about 6 tokens per second on a 4-core machine. 

The C code runs the `0.6B Qwen3` model in full precision for simplicity. Since GGUF models are quantized to 8-bit or lower, you should use the FP32 version by cloning from HF, or you can convert from BF16 yourself via the conversion script in this repo. I tweaked it to ensure the layers are sorted in consecutive numerical order, since memory mapping in C jumps block by block.

### UPDATE
[Sep-01-25] **Prefix caching** feature is added. Multi-turn TTFT is now consistent and the same as in single-turn conversations for the same token counts. In OMP_NUM_THREADS=4, the TTFT is ~2 secs.
```sh
$ make runbaomp
$ OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./runba  Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -r 1 -f 1 -m 1
```
[Aug-15-25] **Batch process** prompts and past conversation turns. Reduce latency by 25% 
```sh
$ gcc -O3 -o runba  runba.c -lm
./runba Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -r 1 -f 1 
```  
[**What's next**] Further TTFT reduction or quantization<br>

## Quick Start

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/gigit0000/qwen3.c.git
cd qwen3.c

# Download FP32 model from Hugging Face
git clone https://huggingface.co/huggit0000/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF-FP32
mv Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF-FP32/Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf ./

# Compile and run
make run
./run Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf
```

## Faster Inference
Use OpenMP and set threads:
```sh
# Compile and run
make runomp
OMP_NUM_THREADS=16 ./run Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf  # the number of your cores
```

You can enable reasoning (-k 1) or multi-turn (-m 1):
```
./run Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -k 1 -m 1 
```
## Description

If you want to extract text files (vocab.txt, merges.txt and header.txt) on your own, you can use the scripts:
```sh
# tokenizer - vocab.txt and merges.txt
python extract_v_m.py Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf

```

### Inference Examples

Multi-turn Conversation with the option m
```
# OMP_NUM_THREADS=16 ./runb Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -m 1 -k 0
Multi-turn = on, thinKing = off, Temperature = 0.60, top-P = 0.95
Press Enter to exit the chat
Enter system prompt (or Enter to skip): Tell me in one sentence
Q: Where is the best spot in Paris?
A: The best spot in Paris is the Eiffel Tower.
Q: What about the second-best spot?
A: The second-best spot in Paris is the Louvre Museum.
```

Reasoning with the option k
```
# OMP_NUM_THREADS=16 ./run Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -k 1
Multi-turn = off, thinKing = on, Temperature = 0.60, top-P = 0.95
Press Enter to exit the chat
Enter system prompt (or Enter to skip): 
Q: Why do stars shine? Give me a quick answer!
A: <think>
Okay, the user is asking why stars shine. Let me start by recalling what I know about stars. Stars are luminous objects that emit light. So, the main reason they shine is because they produce light through nuclear fusion.

Wait, but I should make sure. Stars form from clouds of gas and dust in space. When these clouds cool, they start fusing hydrogen into helium, which releases energy. This energy is what we see as light. So the process is nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, which gives off energy.

I should also mention that the energy from stars is what we perceive as light. Maybe add that this light travels through space and we see it on Earth. But the question is why they shine, so the answer should focus on the energy production.

I need to keep it simple and concise. The user probably wants a quick answer, so no need for too much detail. Let me check if there's any other reason, but I think that's the main one. Alright, I think that's it.
</think>

Stars shine because they produce light through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores. This energy is then released as visible light, giving them their luminous glow.
```
You can enable and monitor TPS with the r option:
```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=6 ./run Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -r 1 
Multi-turn = on, thinKing = off, tps(R) = on, Temperature = 0.60, top-P = 0.95
Press Enter to exit the chat
Enter system prompt (or Enter to skip): You name is Kim.
Q: What is your name?
A: My name is Kim.

## Sampling Visualization

A live dashboard that shows how **temperature** and **top-p** affect token selection in real time. See probability bars, nucleus membership, and which token gets chosen — all from actual model logits.

### Build

```sh
make runviz
```

### Run (3 terminals)

**Terminal 1** — Start the Next.js dashboard:
```sh
cd ../../apps/sampling-viz
npm install   # first time only
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2** — Start the bridge + inference with viz enabled:
```sh
# Install bridge dependency (first time only)
cd ../../tools && npm install && cd -

# Run with visualization hook
node ../../tools/sampling-bridge.mjs ./run_viz Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -v 1 -t 0.6 -p 0.95
```

**Browser** — Open http://localhost:3000

Then interact with the chat in Terminal 2. Each generated token streams a sampling event to the dashboard showing:
- Top-20 token probabilities (bar chart)
- Nucleus membership (green = in, gray = excluded by top-p)
- Chosen token highlighted in gold
- Nucleus stats (size, mass, tail excluded)

### Experiment

Try different temperature and top-p values to see the effect:
```sh
# Very deterministic — top token dominates
node ../../tools/sampling-bridge.mjs ./run_viz Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -v 1 -t 0.2 -p 0.95

# High randomness — flat distribution
node ../../tools/sampling-bridge.mjs ./run_viz Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -v 1 -t 1.2 -p 0.95

# Tight nucleus — few tokens eligible
node ../../tools/sampling-bridge.mjs ./run_viz Qwen3-0.6B-FP32.gguf -v 1 -t 0.6 -p 0.5
```

### How it works

1. `run_viz` (compiled from `run.c` with `-v 1`) emits JSONL sampling events to stderr on each decode step
2. `tools/sampling-bridge.mjs` parses these events and broadcasts via WebSocket (port 3847)
3. `apps/sampling-viz/` (Next.js) connects to the WebSocket and renders live charts

The `-v` flag is off by default — when disabled, `run_viz` behaves identically to `run` with zero overhead.
